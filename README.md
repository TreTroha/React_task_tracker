# React Task Tracker
This is a social media web application built from scratch ideally targeted towards car enthusiasts or gear heads in general! 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS

This application was built using React with CSS for styling and some html to hold the components. This project utilizes 5 different components { AddTask, Button, Header, Task, Tasks } which come together to create the experience for the user. My favorite part of this application is the expandable form on button press.

## Optimizations

Next for this app will be connecting to a DB, I typically use MongoDB because that is what I'm most comfortable with. I also want to add more options to each task such a priority 1-5. This is similiar to a car parts tracker I had built in the past utilizing EJS however the virtual dom that react uses makes the application way less clunky to work around and use.

## Lessons Learned:

This was one of my first builds utilizing React in place of EJS, as mentioned above I am a huge fan of the virtual dom and updating elements/components without the need to reload the page. The applications FEELS so much smoother to use and will alleviate some user frustration as well.
